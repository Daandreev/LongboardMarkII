# Summary

UPDATE: I've added the original Fusion360 File as well as an IGES file for better modelling. I hope that works for most of you!

This is a Dummy of the VESC 4.12 witch is designed by Benjamin Vedder. 
I used his designs to generate a 3D Part to test DIY enclosures. Feel free to contact me, if you find any dismatching parts. I try to adjust these as fast as possible.

All meassurements should be correct by now!

I've added the capacitor board with 3x 63V 680uF capacitors as you can buy it at diyelectricskateboard.com. You can download it as a separat file. My capacitor board is 5mm away from the edge of the VESC as you can see on one of the screenshots.
